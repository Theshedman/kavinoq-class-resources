# The Definitive Guide: Month 1, Week 2 - Version Control & Collaboration Mastery

## The Unabridged Lesson Plan

- **Topic:** From Local History to Global Collaboration: A Complete Guide to Git & GitHub
- **Core Philosophy:** This lesson is divided into two distinct but connected halves. First, we master Git, the tool for managing history on our own machine. Second, we master GitHub, the platform for collaborating with the world. We will learn not just the commands, but the mental models and professional workflows that separate amateurs from engineers.

- **Total Time:** 3.5 - 4 Hours. This is the most important foundational topic in modern software. We will give it the time it demands.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 35 min   | Module 0: The Professional Toolkit Setup         | Guided, Step-by-Step Installation | Install Git on all major OSes. Verify the installation. Perform the crucial one-time global configuration (`git config`). Explain exactly what the `.gitconfig` file is and why it's necessary for attribution.                                                                   |
| 15 min   | Module 1: The "Why" - Ending the Chaos           | Interactive Lecture & Analogy     | The visceral pain of `final_v4_real_final.doc`. The "Magic Time-Traveling Notebook" analogy for Version Control.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45 min   | Module 2: Git - The Local Universe               | Deep Dive Live Coding             | **Local Mastery.** The Three Trees (Working, Staging, Repo). The core loop: `init`, `status`, `add`, `commit`. Professional commit messages. The Time Machine (`git log`). Branching (`checkout -b`) as creating parallel universes. Merging (`merge`) as fusing those universes. |
| 30 min   | Module 3: GitHub - The Global Town Square        | Guided Tour of the Platform       | **Platform Mastery.** What is GitHub? It's more than storage; it's a social platform for code. The anatomy of a repository page. The Issue tracker. User profiles. The concept of "remotes" (`origin`).                                                                           |
| 45 min   | Module 4: The Professional Workflow              | Deep Dive & Live Demo             | **Collaboration Mastery.** Connecting local to remote. SSH setup. The full workflow: `clone`, `push`, `pull`. **The Pull Request (PR)**: the heart of modern collaboration. The Code Review process.                                                                              |
| 30 min   | Module 5: Handling Reality - Conflicts & Changes | Live Troubleshooting              | **Problem-Solving Mastery.** A deep, practical dive into resolving a **merge conflict** from start to finish. Introducing `git stash`: the developer's pause button for handling interruptions.                                                                                   |
| 20 min   | Module 6: Advanced Tools & Concepts              | Conceptual Lecture                | Introduction to `git rebase`: what it is (rewriting history), its main use case (cleaning up local commits), and the golden rule (never rebase shared branches).                                                                                                                  |
| 30 min   | Module 7: The Capstone Exercise                  | In-Class Practical                | A new, more comprehensive in-class exercise that forces students to use the entire workflow, from branching to creating a PR and resolving a planned conflict.                                                                                                                    |
