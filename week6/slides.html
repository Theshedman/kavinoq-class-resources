          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Linux makes this incredibly simple using its built-in package manager,
            <span>apt</span>
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: xx-large;"><span>apt</span> (Advanced Package Tool) is Ubuntu's built-in package manager.
            <span>sudo</span> stands for "Super User Do," which temporarily gives you administrative privileges to
            install software.

          <h2>Git is Your Private Universe</h2>
          <p style="font-size: xx-large;">For now, forget the internet. Forget collaboration. Git is a tool that works
            100% on your local machine.
            It is your private time machine for your project. Everything we do in this module happens only on your
            computer.</p>

          <h4 class="r-fit-text">The Three Trees: The "Kitchen Analogy"</h4>
          <p style="font-size: x-large;">To master Git, you must internalize its three distinct areas.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Working Directory</strong>

              <ul style="font-size: xx-large;">
                <li>
                  <strong>The Analogy:</strong> Your entire kitchen. It's where you have all your ingredients, pots, and
                  pans.
                  It's where the work happens, and it's usually messy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Reality:</strong> The project folder on your computer. You can create, edit, and delete
                  files here.
                  Git is aware of this area, but it doesn't permanently record anything that happens here until you tell
                  it to.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <strong>Staging Area (The Index)</strong>

                <li>
                  <strong>The Analogy:</strong> Your clean cutting board. Before you take a photo for your cookbook, you
                  don't just photograph the whole messy kitchen.
                  You carefully select specific prepared ingredients and arrange them neatly on the cutting board. This
                  is your "staged" photo.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Reality:</strong> A special holding area. When you use the <span>git add</span> command,
                  you are telling Git,
                  "Take this specific change I made and place it on the Staging Area. It is now ready to be included in
                  my next snapshot."

                <li>
                  <strong>The Analogy:</strong> The beautiful, printed cookbook. Once you take the photo of your staged
                  ingredients on the cutting board,
                  you print it on a new page and add it to the book. This page is permanent. You can't un-print it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Reality:</strong> The hidden <span>.git</span> subdirectory inside your project.
                  When you use <span>git commit</span>, Git takes everything on the Staging Area, creates a
                  permanent snapshot (a commit), and stores it forever in the <span>.git</span> directory. This is your
                  project's sacred history.

          <h4>The Happy Path: Fast-Forward Merge</h4>
          <div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: justify;">
            <p>
              Your new feature is complete and tested on its branch. It's time to bring that work into the "Sacred
              Timeline" (<span>main</span>).
              This process is called merging.
            </p>
            <p>
              The simplest case is a "fast-forward" merge. This happens when the <span>main</span> branch has had
              <strong>no new commits</strong> since you created your feature branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Analogy</strong>: You wrote a few new pages for your cookbook in a separate notebook. The main
              cookbook hasn't been touched.
              To merge, you simply tape your new pages onto the end of the main cookbook. The history is a single,
              straight line.

          <h4 class="r-fit-text">The Real World: Three-Way Merge</h4>
          <div style="font-size: xx-large;">
            <p>What if, while you were working on your feature, someone else merged their own feature into
              <span>main</span>? Now the timelines have truly diverged.
            </p>
            <p>You can't just fast-forward main anymore. Git needs to perform a three-way merge.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p class="r-fit-text">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> Git looks at three commits:
          </p>
          <ol style="font-size: xx-large;">
            <li>The tip of your feature branch.</li>
            <li>The tip of the <span>main</span> branch.</li>
            <li>The common ancestor commit where your branch originally split off from <span>main</span>.</li>
          </ol>
          <div style="font-size: x-large;">
            <p>
              It then combines the work from both branches and creates a special new <strong>merge commit</strong> on
              the <span>main</span> branch.
              This merge commit has two parents, tying the two divergent histories back together.
            </p>
            <p>
              The commands are exactly the same: <span>git checkout main</span>, then <span>git merge
                &ltbranch-name&gt</span>. Git is smart enough to know which type of merge to perform.

            It's time to go online. If Git is your private notebook,
            <strong>GitHub is the world's largest library, coffee shop,
              and town square for developers.</strong>

            GitHub is a <strong>website</strong> that provides <strong>hosting for your Git repositories.</strong> 
            But it's so much more:

              <strong>A Cloud Backup:</strong> It's the primary way to back up your local repositories.
